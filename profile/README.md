KAIT-CRONOS is a research project that builds a software-based platform for high-speed, low-latency processing of 8K+ media streams using in-network computing with SRv6 and DPDK.

## About the Project

This research develops an architectural framework that seamlessly integrates networks and computational resources, enabling real-time coordination for high-speed and low-latency processing.

**Target Performance:**
- Speed: 1 Tbps
- Latency: Less than 1 Î¼s

## Software

**sdplane** *(coming soon)*

A high-performance open-source software router built on DPDK for software-defined networking.

Features:
- High-performance packet processing with DPDK
- Layer 2/3 forwarding with ACL, LPM, and FIB support  
- Built-in packet generator for testing
- Network virtualization with TAP interface and VLAN switching
- CLI management interface
- Multi-threading with per-core workers
