KAIT‚ÄëCRONOS is a research project led by Prof. Mitsuru Maruyama at the Ultrahigh-speed Network Research Center, [Kanagawa Institute of Technology (KAIT)](https://en.kait.jp/index.html).
The project is part of the [JST CRONOS](Ultra-high-speed In-Network Computing Platform:JPMJCS24N9) program and focuses on building a software-based platform that enables high-speed, low-latency processing of 8K+ media streams in-network computing using SRv6 and DPDK.\
In fiscal year 2025, Visiting Researcher Dr. Yasuhiro Ohara is leading the development of an SRv6 software router, utilizing DPDK as the underlying technology. DPDK achieves high performance by decoupling CPU core resources and NICs from the OS and processing them directly from user space. However, its internal state is difficult to grasp during operation, requiring specialized expertise for program development. Therefore, we have designed and built a new ‚ÄúDPDK-dock development environment‚Äù consisting of a Shell that allows interactive control of DPDK thread operations and the DPDK thread execution environment (sd-plane), and we are releasing it as open source software. Using this environment enables the development of multiple DPDK software assets, including high-speed software switch and router functions, security functions such as firewalls, and video processing functions.

## üß≠ Research Overview

This research project proposes an architectural framework leveraging in-network computing to facilitate autonomous functional collaboration by seamlessly integrating networks and computational resources. 
This approach allows real-time coordination between the network and computational resources, achieving high-speed and low-latency processing. Additionally, the study introduces a system that shares network status with application and user terminal sides, promoting more streamlined and adaptive network operations.

- Promote standardization, including that of a control plane that facilitates dynamic resource allocation to ensure uninterrupted processing in the event of a failure, using IETF SRv6 End.AN.
  - [SRv6 SFC Architecture with SR-aware Functions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-watal-spring-srv6-sfc-sr-aware-functions/)
- By merging the software router section using DPDK and CPU processing and optimizing the data transfer, we will achieve ultra-high-speed and low latency performance of 1 Tbps and less than 1 Œºs.
- We will facilitate early social implementation through various application demonstration experiments on wide-area testbeds and provide the platform as an OSS.
