KAITâ€‘CRONOS is a research project led by Prof. Mitsuru Maruyama at the Ultrahigh-speed Network Research Center, [Kanagawa Institute of Technology (KAIT)](https://en.kait.jp/index.html).
The project is part of the [JST CRONOS](Ultra-high-speed In-Network Computing Platform:JPMJCS24N9) program and focuses on building a software-based platform that enables high-speed, low-latency processing of 8K+ media streams in-network computing using SRv6 and DPDK.

## ðŸ§­ Research Overview

This research project proposes an architectural framework leveraging in-network computing to facilitate autonomous functional collaboration by seamlessly integrating networks and computational resources. 
This approach allows real-time coordination between the network and computational resources, achieving high-speed and low-latency processing. Additionally, the study introduces a system that shares network status with application and user terminal sides, promoting more streamlined and adaptive network operations.

- Promote standardization, including that of a control plane that facilitates dynamic resource allocation to ensure uninterrupted processing in the event of a failure, using IETF SRv6 End.AN.
- By merging the software router section using DPDK and CPU processing and optimizing the data transfer, we will achieve ultra-high-speed and low latency performance of 1 Tbps and less than 1 Î¼s.
- We will facilitate early social implementation through various application demonstration experiments on wide-area testbeds and provide the platform as an OSS.
